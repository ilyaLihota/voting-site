# Online voting website
It's a website for online voting for everyone. Allows you to create, edit polls, take part in them and see statistics.

To create a survey or take part, you must register (non-registered users can only view the list of polls). After that, you will have a user account in which you can create an unlimited number of polls, edit and delete them.
Each survey can have an unlimited number of questions, and each question has an unlimited number of answer options.

There are no right and wrong answers because this is a site for online voting, we collect user opinions :)

When creating a survey, you can upload a picture that will be displayed on the card of your survey. You must also specify the start time of the survey and its completion since only the currently active polls are displayed on the main page. You can increase the poll card, for this, contact the site administrator.
Questions that have no answer options will not appear in your survey.

Survey results are available only to its creator in the user's account in real-time. Also in the userâ€™s account, you can see the list of polls in which you participated.
